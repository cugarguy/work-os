# WorkOS

Your AI-powered knowledge and time intelligence system that helps you build connected knowledge, track relationships, and understand how work actually takes time.

Capture notes in `NOTES_INBOX.md`, tell your AI assistant to process them, and build a connected knowledge base with people relationships and time intelligence.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amanaiproduct/work-os.git
cd work-os
```

### 2. Run Setup (2 minutes)
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

The setup will:
- Create your workspace directories
- Guide you through initial configuration
- Generate your personalized GOALS.md
- Copy template files

**Note:** Python 3.10+ is only needed if you want to run the MCP server. The basic setup works with just bash.

### 3. Start Using It
```
# In your AI assistant (Claude Code, etc.)
"Read CLAUDE.md and help me build my knowledge base"
```

## How It Works

1. **Capture** - Drop notes into `NOTES_INBOX.md` (no structure needed)
2. **Process** - Say "process my notes" to your AI
3. **Build knowledge** - AI creates connected knowledge documents with wikilinks
4. **Track people** - AI maintains people profiles and relationships
5. **Understand time** - Track how long work takes and get better estimates

### Common Commands

- `"Process my notes"` - Turn notes into knowledge and people updates
- `"Show me what I know about [topic]"` - View knowledge connections
- `"Who knows about [topic]?"` - Find people by expertise
- `"Start work on [description]"` - Begin time tracking
- `"End work"` - Complete time entry
- `"How long does [work] usually take?"` - Get time estimates
- `"Help me break down [large work]"` - Get work breakdown suggestions

### Key Concepts

- **Knowledge Base** - Connected markdown documents with wikilinks [[like this]]
- **People Network** - Profiles tracking relationships and expertise
- **Time Intelligence** - Historical analysis for better work estimates
- **Work Breakdown** - Breaking large work into estimable chunks
- **Distraction Tracking** - Understanding interruption patterns

## Daily Workflow

**Morning:** `"What should I focus on today?"` → Review knowledge areas and time patterns

**During work:** 
- Brain dump into NOTES_INBOX.md
- `"Start work on [description]"` to track time
- `"Record distraction"` when interrupted
- `"End work"` when complete

**End of day:** `"Show my time patterns today"`

**Weekly:** `"Process my notes"` + `"Show my knowledge growth"` + `"Analyze my time trends"`

## Features

- **Connected Knowledge** - Build a knowledge graph with wikilinks
- **People Network** - Track relationships and expertise
- **Time Intelligence** - Understand how work actually takes time
- **Smart Estimates** - Get predictions based on historical patterns
- **Work Breakdown** - Break large work into estimable chunks
- **Distraction Analysis** - Identify interruption patterns
- **Natural Language** - Just talk to your AI
- **MCP Integration** - Works with Claude and other AI assistants
