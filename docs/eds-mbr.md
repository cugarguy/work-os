# Edge Data Services MBR – September 2025

This document provides an update on the Edge Data Services (EDS) business, which consists of DataSync, Transfer Family (includes B2Bi Data Interchange (B2Bi)), and Storage Gateway (SGW). Our services help customers migrate data to AWS, securely exchange files with trading partners and applications hosted outside of AWS, and seamlessly connect applications to cloud storage using common protocols. EDS is currently comprised of 111 builders (105 BIS) and 10 PM (10 BIS), totaling 121 (115 BIS). As of November 2025, EDS has generated $213.6M YTD net revenue (+12.7% YoY, +0.3% vs. OP2).

The EDS portfolio is faced with the following business challenges: 1/ Declining revenue in Storage Gateway ($24.7M YTD, -7.5% YoY) as alternative solutions have become available, offsetting growth of othern services in the portfolio. 2/ Slowing growth rate of Transfer Family over the past two years (+26% in 2023, +17% in 2024, +15% in 2025) due to heavy reliance on SFTP endpoints (X% of ARR) and newer Managed File Transfer (MFT) features taking longer than expected for at scale adoption by enterprises, and 3/ DataSync’s Basic mode pricing model that is below cost for some workloads and relies on unpredictable, large-scale migrations to drive revenue. These challenges are creating headwinds as we work towards achieving sustained 20% YoY growth for EDS to meet our aggressive, top-down 2026 OP2 target ($279M, +18.3% YoY).

In 2025, we made progress towards mitigating challenges in each of the business areas. DataSync expanded Enhanced mode, with its premium, cost-following pricing, to include cross-cloud and on-premises support, leading to increased service revenue ($10.7M YTD, +73.6% YoY) and improved margins (+55pts IM, +142Pts OM). To increasing the pace of adoption by enterprise MFT customers who are just 12% of our customer base but 60% of revenue, Transfer Family has shifted its focus to build capabilities beyond SFTP such as enhancements to web apps, connectors, and AS2/B2Bi. Early signs are showing 28% YoY revenue growth by customers in this segment because they consume all our offerings to modernize their MFT. Since 2023, Storage Gateway has been in KTLO (no new feature launches), and to maximize value for the portfolio, we will shift resources away from Storage Gateway to more impactful platform level initiatives that will unify the customer experience for on-premises appliance deployments and file transfers across our services. In 2026, we will consolidate efforts by focusing on two areas: increasing adoption in the MFT market segment ($3-4B, 10% CAGR) to drive higher revenue growth and improving operational efficiencies through projects such as “Tenon”.

Both DataSync and Transfer Family are seeing healthy demand signals from customers such as Lloyds Banking Group, Netflix, Disney, Roche, Anthropic, and Salesforce. These customers are eager to migrate from legacy MFT solutions that drive their critical business workflows, executing millions of file transfers per month for use cases such as financial reconciliation and reporting, video distribution, lab data pipelines, and AI/ML training and analytics. Our roadmap focuses on closing gaps in our MFT offering and provide a unified experience to build MFT solutions and integrate file transfers into business processes. Our successful implementation of this strategy will be measured by the growth in Transfer Family revenue contributed by customers that are adopting more than just SFTP endpoints (currently 60% of service revenue), and the growth in DataSync revenue contributed by customers that are executing recurring transfers (currently 29% of service revenue) vs. migrations. Appendix X defines a 3-year roadmap of MFT features that will materially close the gap between what we provide today and what builders need to develop customized solutions for their business processes, leading to an expected EDS all-up $XM ARR by 2029, on X% YoY growth.

The remainder of this document reviews our business, operational, and GTM efforts in 2025, followed by a preview of our 2026 roadmap.

2025 performance YTD

In this section, we review the performance of our three services, followed by a review of our operational and GTM efforts YTD.

DataSyncis currently focused on improving performance and scalability by expanding the reach of Enhanced mode that will drive increased revenue through its premium pricing and to lay the foundation for our investments in MFT. YTD revenue is $10.7M (+33% vs. OP2, +74.8% YoY), with a 4-week ARR of $14M (+38% vs. OP2) on usage of 766PB (-0.6% vs. OP2, +32% YoY). We expect to end the year at ~860PB of usage, 52PB (-6%) short of plan. Our miss to plan is largely due to the 2026 OP1 adjustment that moved our EOY target from 869PB to 912PB, due to a temporarily usage spike from Anthropic in May to July (36.9PB) used as input to increase our target. Enhanced mode has exceeded our expectations and led to an increased net ASP of $0.015/GB (+33% YoY) and is now accounting for 31% of service revenue (up from 17% in Q1). Our launch in May’25 of Enhanced mode for cross-cloud transfers enabled 1400+ customers such as NBA, HUMAIN, and Qualtrics to move 32PB of data from other clouds into AWS. Our launch of Enhanced mode for on-premises transfers on 12/15 delivered on our 2025 AWS goal and will help customers such as Disney, Netflix, and Qube Research who need to quickly transfer large amounts of data between on-premises and AWS. From a workload perspective, while we are seeing stronger growth in recurring transfers (+70% YoY, 226PB YTD) from customers such as Nasdaq, Meta, Disney, and Rivian who are using DataSync to drive use cases such as replication, AI workloads, and hybrid data pipelines. vs migrations (+15% YoY, 540PB YTD). Going into 2026 we will transition our investments to focus on making it easier for customers to use DataSync for recurring file transfers as part of their MFT.

Transfer Family & B2Bi ($207M ARR) is focused on expanding MFT adoption to drive revenue growth through large-scale deployments and establish our position as a complete MFT provider. YTD revenue of $178.5M (+14% YoY) is tracking OP2. SFTP (-$3.1M, +13% YoY) and B2Bi (-$0.6M, +X% YoY) are lagging OP2, offset by lower than projected DDC (+$2.7M) and outperformance in web apps (+$0.8M). **SFTP ($203M ARR)** drives 98% of revenue, with workloads segmented into simple file access (<10 endpoints) and MFT (>10 endpoints). While MFT customers are only 12% of our base (2.4K customers), they generate 60% of ARR ($123M) and are growing at 28% YoY represented by enterprises like JPMC, Capital One, and Vanguard who deploy hundreds of SFTP endpoints and adopt our broader product portfolio (web apps, connectors, etc.). SFTP endpoint is a key part of MFT and to adopt our SFTP offering for MFT architectures, MFT customers also need capabilities beyond SFTP endpoints such as connectors, AS2, web apps, and B2Bi (EDI). To drive adoption of SFTP, we plan to invest in non-SFTP endpoints products which are critical components of MFT workloads. We plan to only make pointed investments in SFTP endpoints that are required meet the security, resiliency and observability requirements of MFT customers such as Thomson Reuters, Eli Lily, and Haliburton. **Web apps ($2.9M ARR)** reached $1.8M YTD revenue (+60% vs OP2) with enterprise customers representing 65% of our 750+ customer base. Our recent VPC endpoints launch (11/21/25) has gained early adoption from customers like UKHSA and VicRoads. Looking ahead to H1'2026, we're addressing customers' external sharing needs with Cognito integration (3/31/2026), enhancing the UI with multi-file download capabilities (3/31/2026), and enabling cross-account bucket access with S3 Access Grants (TBD). **AS2 ($1.2M ARR)** YTD usage has grown to 33M messages (+55% YoY, +50% vs OP2), driven by adoption from enterprises like Thomson Reuters and Lululemon, and growing demand to meet traceability requirements from food/medicine supply chain customers such as Abbvie, Foodlogiq and MyMedsAndMe. These customers need improved AS2 scalability, better observability, and additional encryption options, in addition to better cost proposition at high usage volumes (AS2 Repricing doc review with jrgibney@ ETA). While **B2Bi ($99K ARR**) continues to lag OP2 by >90% since the start of the year, our ARR has doubled last year’s OP2 and growing at X% YoY. Migrations by manufacturing/logistics and HCLS customers such as RNDC, Healthfirst, Polywood, and Saatva Mattresses have informed our roadmap. Our 2026 pipeline continues to grow with planned migrations from Abbvie, PQ Corp and Constellation Brands who rely heavily on MFT and EDI for core business operations such as claims processing, regulatory submissions and order-to-cash. Our roadmap prioritizes needs of such customers who will drive larger deal sizes (>$200K/customers) because they will need Transfer Family and B2Bi for their entire EDI applications.

Storage Gatewayis operating in KTLO mode with investments limited to durability improvements, campaigns, patching, and region launches. Our current plan is to maintain the AWS operational bar for the service with minimal HC. In 2025, we assessed bringing a single site NAS replacement offering “Phoenix” leveraging FSx for OpenZFS’s S3 Block driver. However, demand signals for this hybrid storage offering haven’t been as strong as what we are seeing for MFT. As a result, we have paused engineering investments in “Phoenix” and are shifting these resources to strengthen our value proposition for MFT and build “Tenon” (see below) YTD, SGW has generated $24.1M in direct net revenue (-8.3% YoY, -3.8% vs. OP2) with a 4-week ARR of $25.8M (-3% vs. OP2). Revenue is driven primarily by data storage ($21.3M revenue, 434PB, -0.5% YoY, -9.9% vs. OP2) and data ingest ($1.74M revenue, 902PB, +6.1% YoY, +16% vs. OP2). **Data Storage ($21.3M ARR):** Volume storage continues to decline (-8.4% YoY). While Tape storage is growing modestly (+1.2% YoY) from our T100 customers, revenue declined (-3.9% YoY) due to both a deletion of 35PB of tape data from Glacier Deep Archive in Q1/Q2 and an ongoing decline as more customers moving tapes to Glacier/GDA (reducing $/GB). Customer count for both gateway types continues to decline (-14% YoY). **Data Ingest ($1.5M ARR):** Tape and Volume data ingest continues to decline with customer count. S3 FGW is growing at a measured pace (727PB YTD, +9.9% YoY).

Internal adoption:AmazonLink is an internal service that processes billions of EDI messages exchanged with 3P vendors by 400+ teams across Amazon such as Amazon Transportation and Amazon Business. AmazonLink moved their inbound SFTP traffic (5% of total traffic) to Transfer Family in 2024 and is moving their AS2 (35% of traffic) starting Jan 2026. With contributions from AmazonLink’s away team, we have built AS2 features that are needed by our external customers such as Abbvie, Portbase, and Geodis. Driven by the success of this partnership, Amazon Link is also evaluating B2Bi as a replacement for their existing OpenText Contivo Data Transformation Engine. We are working with the team through the AS2 migration and defining the scope of B2Bi POC as part of AmazonLink's OP process. We are also seeing continued use of DataSync by internal customers such as Amazon Studios, Kuiper, AGI, and various SDO teams. YTD 4.1K internal accounts have used DataSync to move 326 PiB of data (+43% YoY).

**Operations**
Our focus in 2025 is on achieving operational efficiencies by unifying mechanisms across EDS, increasing builder awareness and adoption of AI, and defining a common unified on-prem appliance “Tenon”. While pursuing these objectives, we will continue to deliver against service table-stakes, such as maintaining our security posture, leveraging automation for our region builds, and satisfying EC2 campaign priorities.

Infrastructure / Operating Margin: As of November YTD, EDS is achieving 68.2% IM and 28.3% OM. We strive to maintain at least 70% IM and 30% OM across our services. Transfer Family/B2Bi (X, Y, Z) and DataSync (X, Y, Z) are offset by decrease in SGW IM (-0.5%, -25Pts YoY, -34Pts vs. OP2) and OM (-67%, -24.2Pts YoY, -30Pts vs. OP2), which we attribute primarily to declining revenue in the service.

AI Adoption: [Tiebing Zhang](https://quip-amazon.com/TFL9EAxNRw8) to update We are committed to staying on top of the latest advancements in AI builder tools and employing them as broadly and consistently as is prudent. We believe this will deliver velocity benefits for the service and reduce builder toil on recurring activities such as weekly dashboard investigations, gathering logs and metrics to aid in the investigation of tickets. All EDS services have onboarded to Oncall Assistant (Agentic First Response, CloudWatch Investigation) and are fine-tuning runbooks to improve effectiveness of these tools.

Security: We are enhancing our security posture in three main areas: patching compliance, AL2023 support, and alignment with broader AWS security initiatives.

All EDS services are continuing to maintain 99+% SLA compliance for Prod hosts. For Non-Prod hosts, EDS services do not have an automated solution for patching hosts in personal dev accounts. To address this, we are planning to invest in an automated solution by Q2’26. In the case of Storage Gateway, gamma integration test account is used for testing old versions of gateway software and validating upgrades from older gateway releases. We will pursue an exception of this account. We will also migrate BONES-based pipelines to MFN in Q2’26, mitigating the high-side engineer coordination needed in ADC partitions.

In anticipation of AL2 deprecation in Jun 2026, Storage Gateway and DataSync teams are replacing the OS platform for on-prem VM images with AL2023. The new VM image for both services supports atomic A/B deployments for reliable software updates, adds rollback capabilities, and reduces downtime for future OS upgrades. SGW made AL2023 images available to customers starting Jul 2025, and started the migration campaign in Dec 2025 through PHD/Email notifications to customers. DataSync will make AL2023 images available with the Enhanced mode launch starting in December and the migration campaign is targeted to begin in Q3’26. EDS services plan to upgrade our AWS service fleets to AL2023 in 1H’26.

Lastly, we’ll continue investing in security-focused efforts to ensure our services adhere to AWS wide campaigns and best practices. These include JDK17+ migration (ECD: Q2 2026), DataSync’s adoption of Secrets Manager for credential management (ECD: Jan 2026), and other security campaigns like Turtle migration/Odin cleanup in non-commercial regions (Completed: Oct 2025). Storage Gateway started migrating services to JDK17/21. As of Dec 2025, we completed the migration for 8 out of 15 services. We plan to complete the remaining before the end of Q1 2026. We are utilizing tools like IronHide to accelerate the migrations. As expected, we are seeing lower memory, cpu utilization and improvements in performance in some areas. After gathering the performance stats in Prod environment, we plan to tune our ASG policies to take advantage of these improvements.

Region Parity: Regional Build Automation (RBA) has successfully standardized our expansion process across our service portfolio, enabling us to meet our target of launching in new commercial regions within 90 days of their general availability. DataSync's consistent performance in recent regional launches has earned it an upgrade to Globally Expanding Launch Blocking status. However, Transfer Family has faced delays due to web app dependency issues, which we're addressing by separating web app deployment from core service launches and working more closely with dependency teams.

Despite the challenges associated with building a region in new partition, all EDS services have completed the THF region build prior to the region getting fenced. Datasync and SGW teams are building associated services in FFZ region with a target to launch in Mar 2026. See Appendix F for current region build status.

Campaigns: We've aligned with AWS EC2 initiatives on several key campaigns. The Turtle Adoption Accelerator program has helped us make headway in eliminating persistent IAM credentials, and our Pipeline Freshness work has reduced average staleness to under 28 days, speeding code delivery. On 9/16 we completed deployment of IPv6 support for SGW, following completion by DataSync, Transfer Family (excluding Web apps and Connectors), and B2Bi earlier this year. We still have a small amount of work to support IPv6 in the AWS Console, which we expect to complete by 4/30/2026. Transfer Family will complete IPv6 for Web apps once supported by Identity Center (est. 9/29), and IPv6 for SFTP Connectors by 12/30. As of 9/30, all EDS services have added support for VPC endpoint policies across the EDS portfolio. We will also add FIPS support to DataSync and Transfer Family PrivateLink endpoints. These enhancements will further increase our security and compliance posture and are important to customers in Financial Services and Public Sector. For the remainder of 2025, we are focusing on AWS Accounts Post Closure Data Management to remove metadata from databases (ECD: Jan 2026). Please refer to Appendix G for the status of 2025 AWS campaigns.

**GTM**
Our GTM efforts differ between services. We have found that the best GTM strategy for our services is to engage the field and partner community through broad-scale 1:many engagements, using vertical-specific content vs. 1:1 engagement with propensity-based accounts Although the target market segment for Transfer Family is small relative to other AWS services, the product has well-defined sales motions with the field, Technical Field Community (TFC) and partners that target a clear customer base, enabling us to effectively leverage partners and rely on SFDC as a valid source of pipeline data. On the other hand, DataSync is still leveraged primarily by customers as an admin-driven tool to run migrations and replicate data, making sales motions difficult and limiting pipeline effectiveness. As we build more MFT capabilities into DataSync, we expect clear sales motions to emerge in verticals such as M&E, Life Sciences, and FinServ where MFT needs are prevalent, enabling us to leverage GTM more effectively. As we expand into the builder community (from admins), we are seeing success with Terraform modules for both Transfer Family and DataSync. These modules build on Terraform resource primitives to help customers deploy solutions such as DataSync cross-account S3 transfers or managing Transfer Family endpoint users. In 2025, we’ve seen over 22K Terraform module downloads across our services. Our field team has also delivered six self-service Transfer Family workshops over 50 times to 380+ participants, closing 30 opportunities worth $7.35M ARR (83.75% YoY). These workshops led to the creation of opportunities from AbbVie, CompuCom, Tapestry and Kingfisher PLC (closing in Q1 2026), signaling that customers prefer modular learning content they can access independently. .(2026 GTM plan review with jrgibney DATE) Given the KTLO state of SGW, we have minimized our GTM motions for the service

2026 Plan

Below we present our current plan for 2026, broken into near-term deliverables (1H’26) and strategic launches targeted for later in the year (2H’26). Although our near-term deliverables are more solidified, we consider this plan to be aspirational pending guidance on HC availability, campaign and region build requirements, and any AWS-wide initiatives. The plan aligns to our strategy of increasing revenue through MFT adoption in DataSync and Transfer Family and improving operational efficiencies through the launch of [Tenon]. SGW will continue to operate in KTLO mode with no investments beyond mandatory campaigns, initiatives, and region launches.

**1H’26 deliverables**

Our directional roadmap for 1H’26 is focused on deliverables in three areas: MFT features, enterprise resiliency and availability for MFT workloads, and platform-level improvements.

MFT features: We will continue the rollout of DataSync Enhanced mode by launching support for EFS and FSx locations, enabling customers such as Meta who are eager to use DataSync for FSx Lustre transfers to power their AI pipelines. We will also launch DataSync support for Google workload identity federation, giving customers such as Anthropic and Lloyds Banking Group the ability to use short-term auth credentials when copying data to/from Google Cloud Storage. Transfer Family web apps will launch support for Cognito authentication, enabling customers to provide S3 upload/download access to partners and other 3rd parties that sit outside the customer’s organization. To unlock Transfer Family adoption in Transportation & Logistics and distribution such as Geodis, and Sintel, that use SFTP/AS2 to exchange EDI with trading partners in EMEA and LATAM, we will add support for the EDIFACT format (top PFR for B2Bi). To help customers such as Abbvie and Quidel Ortho who are looking to migrate their regulatory workflows to AWS, we will launch customizable AS2 message attributes, giving them the ability to customize AS2 HTTP headers to meet requirements by regulatory bodies such as the FDA. Additionally, for large healthcare customers such as Healthfirst (already committed customer waiting for functionality), that require full coverage of HIPAA X12 document types, and large logistics customers such as Railinc that require support of latest X12 versions, we will add support for all these documents and versions. For that, we are entering into a licensing agreement with X12 for which we have already obtained Legal’s sign off. (pending Jhhayd@‘s [approval](https://approvals.amazon.com/Approval/Details/44006434)) .

Enterprise resiliency and availability: Transfer Family customers like FINRA, Goldman Sachs, and Toyota want to improve their disaster-recovery posture by deploying SFTP endpoints with multi-region replication. In 1H’26, we will launch a beta of this feature to gather early feedback and prepare for a GA launch by re:invent 2026. DataSync customers such as Anthropic, Salesforce, and Arrowstreet Capital need to move data between clouds, but must use their private networks (vs. the internet) for performance and security. To address this need, we will launch private cross-cloud network connectivity for DataSync Enhanced mode which will also enable them to use the recent launch of Interconnect. We will also launch DataSync support for shared VPCs, enabling customers to use DataSync in VPC environments where network resources, such as DataSync agents, are activated in a shared account but need to access storage resources in other accounts.

Platform-level improvements: Building on our success with Terraform solutions in 2025, we will add modules for Transfer Family web apps, AS2, and B2Bi, making it easier for customers to deploy and manage solutions in their Terraform-managed AWS environments. We will also announce DataSync support for Secrets Manager, making it easier for customers to securely store credentials for storage systems accessed by DataSync. Finally, we will add operational dashboards for Transfer Family customers to better monitor their SFTP file transfer workloads.

Collectively, these launches will expand our MFT capabilities to new customer workloads and strengthen our resiliency and security posture, enabling us to better attract enterprise MFT customers.

**2H’26 initiatives**

To further build out our MFT capabilities in 2026, we are actively pursuing three initiatives. The first is a unified customer experience for file transfers and deployments. MFT requirements such as folder synchronization, event-driven transfers, scaling to run 1000s of transfer jobs, audit logs, and workflow pipelines to both Transfer Family and DataSync customers. We see this as an opportunity to provide a common experience for customers who need managed file transfers and create operational efficiencies across both services. We plan to bring forward a PRFAQ in Q1’26 outlining our vision for a unified file transfer CX. For on-premises deployments, we are defining “Tenon”, a new internal service that will eliminate the redundant work being done across service teams that offer edge products, such as DataSync and Storage Gateway. It will provide a common platform for building, deploying, and maintaining software instances that are distributed by AWS, and deployed in customer environments. [Tenon] builds on years of experience supporting edge deployments within customer environments and is expected to reduce operational burden for DataSync and Storage Gateway teams, as well as provide a foundational service for other AWS teams such as Backup and DRS that provide on-premises solutions. We are actively working on gathering requirements and building design concepts to finalize the [Tenon] architecture. Our goal for 2026 is to deliver an MVP that supports the AWS Backup [RipTide] launch, followed by support for Storage Gateway and DataSync in 2027. We will provide a functional platform POC in early Q1’26 to demonstrate the core service components, which includes software image generation, activation and authentication, container orchestration, disk management, and basic monitoring. (PRFAQ review with AWS Backup by 12/19, leadership reviews in Jan’26)

Our second initiative is focused on completing the DataSync Enhanced mode rollout. With the launch of EFS and FSx support in 1H’26, the only remaining storage location is HDFS. From there, we will transition to implementing the work necessary to start migrating customers from the DataSync “Classic” data plane to Vahana, the data plane that powers Enhanced mode. Based on current Enhanced mode progress, we expect this customer migration effort to begin no sooner than Q1 2027. See Appendix X for the full Vahana roadmap and estimated timelines for Classic shutdown.

Our third initiative looks to further strengthen our resiliency posture for enterprise MFT customers. In addition to the multi-region SFTP endpoints launch, we will add support for durable Event Bridge events which is critical for business processes that rely on MFT. We will also launch fine-grained data access controls using S3 Access Grants, enabling customers to more easily limit and manage S3 access for their users.

**Operations**

The target reduction ranges from 25-50%, encompassing areas like KTLO efforts, region build processes, manual ticket investigations, CICD processes, and testing workflows automated graph investigations, reducing weekly dashboard investigation time from 5-6 hours for on-call engineers

The following list is captured based on [Sheet1: EDS 2026 Operations centric projects](https://quip-amazon.com/OKJUAPFtkQgb#temp:C:dKN385acc2b176c492382f49c10a).

**Campaigns** (Data Deletion after Account Closure, JDK 17/21 migration, Managed Fleets Next, Quantum-safe cryptography, SDK V2 migration, AL2023 migration for cloud services, Graviton support, FIPS enabled VPC Endpoint)

1. **Data Deletion after Account Closure**: Storage Gateway and AWS Transfer services need to complete the deletion of customer metadata as part AES campaign for 2025. Even though the work has started in 2025, we plan to complete the remaining work by Jan 30 2026.
2. **JDK 17 Migration** Drive JDK17+ migration for Java-based applications built on JDK 8, JDK 11, Crema JDK 8.17, and Crema JDK 11.17. As of Dec 2025, we completed the migration for 8 out of 15 Storage Gateway services to JDK17/21. We plan to complete the remaining before the end of Q1 2026.
3. **FIPS enabled VPC endpoint** Even though we added support for FIPS enabled VPC endpoints for SGW, due to dependency on S3’s support for FIPS enabled VPC endpoint, we will deliver this feature to customers once our integration with S3 is completed (ECD: Mar 2026)
4. **Managed Fleets Next** Migration of BONES-based pipelines to MFN will reduce the coordination needed with high-side engineers in ADC partitions and reduces the builder toil.
5. **SDK V2** AWS SDKs released critical fixes addressing potential data corruption issues during upload/download operations. Teams should upgrade to latest SDK versions to ensure data integrity. Even though SDK V1 will continue to be supported, newer features and bug fixes will not be supported.
6. **AL2023 Migrations** In light of AL2 deprecation in Jun 2026, all EDS services should plan to migrate backend services to AL2023.
7. **Graviton Support** Validate Graviton support to reduce operational costs and decrease operator pain from Intel instance unavailability across service fleets, this is especially important in newer regions.

**Durability Projects**

Implement Gateway **VM Snapshot detection** to avoid potential data loss on Volume and Tape gateways.
We implemented automatic detection of tape corruption in 2025 which alerts Storage Gateway on-call and requires us to reach out to customers manually. Now that we have built confidence in our detection mechanism, we would like to inform customers automatically at the time of Tape archival request.

**Region Expansion** Maintain constant upkeep of RBA scripts and tool deprecations for new region builds. Update chainreaction template to support new partitions by automating partition-specific tasks. In case of AWS Transfer, additional effort is required to launch in US ADC regions which require coordination with high side engineers.

**Gateway Health Diagnostics** Enhance resource health visibility and diagnostics with richer status reporting, actionable guidance, and intuitive dashboards to help customers self-diagnose frequently escalated issues (file-share offline, AD diagnostics, gateway update failures etc).

**Automated On-Prem Image Validation in EC2** Expand VMTestBench (developed by ADC/DataSync team) to support SGW gateway image validation needs, avoiding manual validation of gateway on-prem images across all ADC partitions.

**AI Tooling Strategy** Leverage AI to reduce operational burden by automating routine tasks, streamlining incident response, improving operator efficiency, and addressing root causes of recurring issues.
