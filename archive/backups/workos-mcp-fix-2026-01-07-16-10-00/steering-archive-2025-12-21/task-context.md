# Task File Context

When working with task files in the Tasks/ directory:

## Always Reference Goals

Every task's Context section should explicitly reference which goal from GOALS.md it supports. Use specific quotes or section headings.

## Status Codes

- `n` = not started
- `s` = started (actively working)
- `b` = blocked (waiting on something)
- `d` = done (completed)

## Best Practices

1. Keep Next Actions specific and actionable
2. Update Progress Log with dates when making changes
3. Link to relevant Knowledge/ files in resource_refs
4. Estimate time realistically (in minutes)
5. If a task doesn't support any goal, question whether it should be done

## When Updating Tasks

- Always read the full task file first
- Preserve existing Progress Log entries
- Add new log entry with today's date
- Update status appropriately
- Keep Context section aligned with current goals
