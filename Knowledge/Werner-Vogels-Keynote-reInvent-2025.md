# Werner Vogels Keynote - re:Invent 2025

## Overview
Watched Werner Vogels' keynote presentation at re:Invent 2025.

**Theme:** Will AI take my job away or make me obsolete? 
**Answer:** Maybe it'll take your job, but it won't make you obsolete. This is another time to evolve (like we've seen several times over the past three decades).

## Key Takeaways: 5 Keys for Developers to Succeed

### 1. The Renaissance Developer is Curious
- **Experiment = willing to fail**
  - Drives learning - you can't learn if you already know the outcome
  - Fail and be gently corrected
  - Failed builds and broken assumptions are what we learn
- **Curiosity leads to learning, and learning is social**
- **Your curiosity + your skills = change the world**
- **"We are not what we know, but what we are willing to learn"**

### 2. The Renaissance Developer Thinks in Systems
- **Complex systems are interconnected and produce their own patterns over time**
- **Systems have lives of their own**
- **Systems thinking:** Changing the ecology when making major changes
  - Example: Removing wolves from Yellowstone (ecosystem impact)
  - Personal example: Removing mosquitos from Assateague
- **Each change impacts patterns**
- **Feedback/reinforcement loops and balancing loops**
- **Look at the full system, then find small targeted changes**

### 3. The Renaissance Developer Communicates
- **Practice, develop, and communicate**
- **Human to human = ambiguous (natural language)**
- **Human to machine = precise (programming language)**
  - Moving to ambiguous with natural language processing
- **Specifications reduce ambiguity**
- **Kiro spec-driven development**
  - AI has transformed iteration
  - Kiro brings precision to natural language
- **Clear communication reduces mistakes**

### 4. The Developer is the Owner of Their Software
- **Own the quality of your software**
- **"Help us build...harder, better, faster, stronger" - Daft Punk**
- **The work is yours, not the tool's**
- **More review needed as more code is being produced**
  - **Verification debt:** Too much to review, too much to understand
  - **Hallucinations:** Produce what you ask for, but not what you want

**Mechanisms to prevent issues:**
- Spec-driven development
- Automated reasoning
- Automated testing
- Durability reviews (S3 example) - model risks of suggested changes
- Code reviews - knowledge transfer

**Mechanisms vs good intentions:**
- Andon chord (stop the line when issues found)

### 5. The Developer is a Polymath (Many Learn)
- **Polymath:** Individual whose knowledge spans many different subjects (Da Vinci example)
- **I-shaped developer:** Goes deep in one area
- **T-shaped developer:** Depth and breadth - deep in one domain and broad in understanding

### Final Thought: Pride in Your Work
- **Your best work is hidden** - users don't think about you or anyone working behind the scenes
- **Have pride in your work**
- **Professional pride in operational excellence defines the best builders**
- **They build the proper thing, even when no one is watching**
