# THF Pricing - Timeline and Three Separate Actions

## Overview
THF pricing has three separate actions with three different teams, which created confusion about responsibilities and sign-offs.

## Three Separate Actions

### 1. THF Pricing Setup (Actual Pricing)
- **What:** The actual pricing being used for THF
- **Timeline:** Reviewed in November
- **Status:** Complete
- **Team:** Pricing team

### 2. THF Pricing Page
- **What:** Public-facing pricing page
- **Timeline:**
  - 11/10: Initial review, left feedback
  - 11/20: Second review after feedback updates, noted different issue, submitted ticket
  - 11/29 (Friday after Thanksgiving): Escalation email sent (8 days after ticket)
    - Escalated to [[Jody]] that page hadn't been approved yet
    - **Bob was on PTO this day**
    - [[Bassem]] was on call and resolved the issue
  - 12/05: Meeting with Jerry Han and Bassem about pricing page fix
- **Status:** Complete (as of 12/05)
- **Team:** Pricing console team

### 3. THF Pricing Calculator
- **What:** Pricing calculator tool
- **Timeline:**
  - Late last week: Notified to review by Friday
  - Completed review same day email came out
  - Submitted ticket for corrections
- **Status:** Pending fixes
- **Team:** Pricing calculator team

## Confusion in 12/08 1:1 with Smitha
- [[Smitha]] asked about "Friday email" escalation to Jody
- I thought she meant this past Friday (12/06)
- She meant Friday 11/29 (day after Thanksgiving)
- I was on PTO that day, Bassem was on call and resolved
- Smitha felt I should have led the resolution
- Confusion about responsibility given work had been handed off

## Key Learnings
- Three parallel pricing workstreams created confusion
- PTO timing coincided with escalation
- Need clearer handoff protocols when on PTO
- Bassem successfully resolved while on call
