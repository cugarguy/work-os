## LTO Tape Technology

In the context of data storage and backup, LTO refers to an open-format magnetic tape technology. The numbers indicate the specific generation of the technology, each offering increased capacity and transfer speeds: 

- **LTO-6 (LT06)**: Offers a native (uncompressed) storage capacity of 2.5 TB and a compressed capacity of up to 6.25 TB.
- **LTO-7 (LT07)**: Offers a native capacity of 6 TB and a compressed capacity of up to 15 TB.
- **LTO-8 (LT08)**: Offers a native capacity of 12 TB and a compressed capacity of up to 30 TB.
	- LTO-8 drives also support a special "Type M" format for new, unused LTO-7 cartridges, increasing their native capacity to 9 TB (referred to as M8 media).
