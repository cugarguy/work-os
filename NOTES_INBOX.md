## System Migration Notice - 2025-12-19

**CRITICAL SYSTEM CHANGE PENDING**

Higher level project will modify knowledge data storage architecture:

**Current Structure (to be migrated):**
- People/ → Will move to shared knowledgebase
- Knowledge/ → Will move to shared knowledgebase  
- Tasks/ → Will move to shared knowledgebase
- daily-notes/ → Will move to shared knowledgebase
- Meeting records → Will move to shared knowledgebase

**New Architecture:**
- Shared knowledgebase becomes single source of truth
- Multiple agents will access same knowledge repository
- Eliminates data silos between agents

**Status:** Awaiting migration completion
**Next Action:** Verify access to shared knowledgebase and update workflows once migration complete

**Impact Assessment:**
- MCP tools may need path updates
- Workflow references will need updating
- Agent instructions may need modification
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing will be enabled
