# System Directory

Internal system files used by PersonalOS. These files are auto-generated and managed by the system.

## Files

- **session_tracker.json** - Tracks current session state, active tasks, and context for continuity across restarts
- **WorkOS.base** - Base configuration for workspace views

## Note

These files are gitignored by default as they contain session-specific data.
